# Introduction to the Linux Kernel

The Linux kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system. It manages hardware resources and provides essential services for user applications.

## What is the Kernel?

The kernel is the fundamental part of an operating system that manages:

- **Hardware Resources**: CPU, memory, storage, network
- **Process Management**: Creating, scheduling, and terminating processes
- **Memory Management**: Allocating and managing system memory
- **Device Drivers**: Interfacing with hardware devices
- **Security**: Access control and protection mechanisms

### Key Characteristics

- **Monolithic Design**: Most OS services run in kernel space
- **Open Source**: Source code freely available and modifiable
- **Highly Configurable**: Can be customized for specific needs
- **Portable**: Runs on many different hardware architectures

## Kernel Space vs User Space

```bash
# Check current process context
cat /proc/$$/maps | head -5

# Kernel modules loaded
lsmod | head -5

# System calls available
man 2 intro
```

### Kernel Space

- Privileged execution mode
- Direct hardware access
- Critical system functions
- Protected from user applications

### User Space

- Unprivileged execution mode
- Access hardware through kernel
- Application execution environment
- Protected by kernel

## Why Build from Source?

### Advantages

- **Customization**: Enable/disable specific features
- **Optimization**: Tune for specific hardware
- **Security**: Apply custom patches
- **Learning**: Understand kernel internals
- **Control**: Full control over included components

### Challenges

- **Complexity**: Requires deep understanding
- **Time**: Compilation takes significant time
- **Maintenance**: Must track security updates
- **Testing**: Extensive testing required

## Kernel in Our Distribution

Our custom Linux distro uses kernel source for:

- **Security Hardening**: Custom security modules
- **Container Support**: Namespaces, cgroups, overlayfs
- **Minimalism**: Only essential drivers and features
- **Performance**: Optimized for general-purpose use

### Key Kernel Features for Our Distro

```bash
# Check kernel configuration options
# (Will be covered in later chapters)
grep CONFIG_SECURITY Makefile
grep CONFIG_NAMESPACES Makefile
grep CONFIG_CGROUPS Makefile
```
